Computes the d-invariant of a graph.

# Input
Name of a .csv file. Each row should look like `u,v` representing an edge coming out of vertex `u` and going into vertex `v`. 

# Usage

> Compute d-invariant of a single graph:

`python main.py example_graph_1.csv`
> Compute the d-invariant of multiple graphs:

`python main.py example_graph_1.csv example_graph_2.csv`
> Compute the d-invariant of many graphs with similar name:

`python main.py example_graph_*.csv`
